								<h3>Education</h3>
								<h4>Astrophysics PhD student, University of Leeds, UK. October 2019 – present.</h4>
								<p>Thesis title: 3D simulations of rocky exoplanets and future observations; Advisors: Professor Dan Marsh, Dr Catherine Walsh</p>
								<p>My thesis focuses on simulating rocky worlds and understanding their climates, chemistry, and habitability. I use and modify the Community Earth System Model (CESM2), mostly the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM6) configuration, to simulate paleoclimates and exoplanets.</p>
								<p>I simulated early Earth with a younger Sun and with varied atmospheric oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) concentrations.</p>
								<p>I used the Planetary Spectrum Generator (PSG) to determine how detectable specific planetary properties (e.g. chemical species such as ozone and oxygen; temporal variability) are using the next generation of telescopes (e.g. LUVOIR).</p>
								<p>I am performing simulations for tidally‑locked M dwarf exoplanets (Proxima Centauri and TRAPPIST‑1 systems) and will predict observations of these exoplanets.</p>
								<p>I was selected competitively as a Priestley Climate Scholar.</p>
								<h4>MPhys integrated masters student, University of Manchester, UK. October 2015 – June 2019</h4>		
								<p>Two MPhys projects: 1. Investigating and defining habitability metrics for all known exoplanets. 2. Designing an optimized telescope search for habitable exoplanets using the Besançon galactic model. Most optional courses taken were related to astrophysics (e.g. Astrophysical plasmas, General relativity, Exoplanets).</p>			

</p>
								<h3>Funding</a></h3>
								<h4>STFC studentship. October 2019 – April 2023.</h4>
								<p>A 3.5-year STFC studentship (approximately worth £75,000).</p>

								<h3>Teaching</a></h3>
								<h4>Lab demonstrating, University of Leeds, UK. October 2019 – present.</h4>
								<p>I have taught experiments in the Phys 10001 undergraduate laboratory to 1st year students including: the determination of Planck’s constant; measurement of Earth’s magnetic field, spectrometer measurement of sodium lines; viscosity of glycerine using Stokes Law; electrical circuits; the understanding of random Gaussian measurements using a dartboard
experiment. I have also marked lab workbooks and formal reports on several of these experiments.</p>

								<h3>Organisation</a></h3>
								<h4>Priestley scholar, University of Leeds, UK. January 2020 – December 2021.</h4>
								<p>I attended multiple seminars on interdisciplinary topics relating to climate change, including transport, climate finance, climate modelling, and climate justice. I co-organised a seminar on climate finance, as well as a monthly journal club focussed on climate science topics.</p>

								<h4>Internal astrophysics group sessions, University of Leeds, UK. January 2020 – present.</h4>
								<p>I have arranged and chaired internal seminars for the University of Leeds Astrophysics group. Additionally, I have organised and led weekly informal science sessions where members of the group get together to discuss their current work. During this time, I have included a journal club for astronomy session which has run once every three weeks.</p>

								<h4>Treasurer for University of Manchester Men’s Hockey Club, UK. May 2017 – May 2018.</h4>
								<p>I was elected out from a club of approximately 80 members. I managed up to £20,000 in financial transactions between the club, club members, the university’s Athletic Union, and between several different organisations.</p>
