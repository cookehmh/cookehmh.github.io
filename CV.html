								<h3>Education</h3>
								<h4>Astrophysics PhD student, University of Leeds, UK. October 2019 – present.</h4>
								<p>Thesis title: 3D simulations of rocky exoplanets and future observations; Advisors: Professor Dan Marsh, Dr Catherine Walsh</p>
								<ul><li>My thesis focuses on simulating rocky worlds and understanding their climates, chemistry, and habitability. I use and modify the Community Earth System Model (CESM2), mostly the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM6) configuration, to simulate paleoclimates and exoplanets.</li>
								<li>I simulated early Earth with a younger Sun and with varied atmospheric oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) concentrations.</li>
								<li>I used the Planetary Spectrum Generator (PSG) to determine how detectable specific planetary properties (e.g. chemical species such as ozone and oxygen; temporal variability) are using the next generation of telescopes (e.g. LUVOIR).</li>
								<li>I am performing simulations for tidally‑locked M dwarf exoplanets (Proxima Centauri and TRAPPIST‑1 systems) and will predict observations of these exoplanets.</li>
								<li>I was selected competitively as a Priestley Climate Scholar.</li></ul>
								<h4>MPhys integrated masters student, University of Manchester, UK. October 2015 – June 2019</h4>		
								<p>Two MPhys projects:</p>
								<ol><li>Investigating and defining habitability metrics for all known exoplanets.</li>
								<li>Designing an optimized telescope search for habitable exoplanets using the Besançon galactic model. Most optional courses taken were related to astrophysics (e.g. Astrophysical plasmas, General relativity, Exoplanets).</li></ol>
								<h3>Funding</a></h3>
								<h4>STFC studentship. October 2019 – April 2023.</h4>
								<ul><li>A 3.5-year STFC studentship (approximately worth £75,000).</li>	
								<li>Funding for travel and funding for the conference fee to attend the 3rd Eddy Cross Disciplinary Symposium: Sun, Earth, Planet, Space, Atmosphere and Ocean, in Vail, Colorado, USA (total $2,800).</li></ul>

								<h3>Software experience</a></h3>
								<ul>
								<li>I have used and developed an open‑source model (CESM2‑WACCM6). I have read Fortran‑90 code to understand how certain calculations in
WACCM6 are made. I modified the Fortran‑90 code to set up different planetary conditions (e.g. altered upper boundary conditions, tidally locked
the model).</li>
								<li>Advanced user of Python for atmospheric data analysis, e.g., matplotlib, pandas, numpy, and xarray.</li>
								<li>Developing open‑source Python code in Jupyter Notebook to analyse vast amounts of climate data that can switch between different types of plots and datasets. I developed the Stellar Wind and Irradiance Module (SWIM), a flexible notebook for multi‑model use that downloads Mega‑MUSCLES stellar spectra and scales the exoplanet to any exoplanet chosen by the user.</li>
								<li>I used and developed a pipeline to interact with the Planetary Spectrum Generator (PSG). I used new methods (where I swapped particular atmo‑
								spheric components) to analyse the results for the WACCM6 oxygenated scenarios.</li>
								<li>Coding experience in C++ during my master’s degree.</li>
								</ul>
								</p>

								<h3>Teaching</a></h3>
								<h4>Lab demonstrating, University of Leeds, UK. October 2019 – May 2022.</h4>
								<p>I have taught experiments in the Phys 10001 undergraduate laboratory to 1st year students including: the determination of Planck’s constant; measurement of Earth’s magnetic field, spectrometer measurement of sodium lines; viscosity of glycerine using Stokes Law; electrical circuits; the understanding of random Gaussian measurements using a dartboard
experiment. I have also marked lab workbooks and formal reports on several of these experiments.</p>
								<h4>Informal MPhys student supervision, University of Leeds, UK. October 2021 – March 2022.</h4>
								<p>I aided B. Butcher to produce and analyse transmission spectra of Jupiter‑sized exoplanets. I helped I. Willis analyse WACCM data and produce figures using Python.</p>
								<h4>Introductory python course, University of Leeds, UK. September 2022.</h4>
								<p>Introduction to Python lesson during a Community Earth System Model (CESM) tutorial. I demonstrated data visualisation using Xarray, Matplotlib, and Cartopy in functions combined with IPyWidgets in a Jupyter notebook</p>

								<h3>Organisation and citizenship</a></h3>
								<h4>Priestley scholar, University of Leeds, UK. January 2020 – December 2021.</h4>
								<p>I attended multiple seminars on interdisciplinary topics relating to climate change, including transport, climate finance, climate modelling, and climate justice. I co-organised a seminar on climate finance, as well as a monthly journal club focussed on climate science topics.</p>

								<h4>Internal seminars chair, University of Leeds, UK. January 2020 – present.</h4>
								<p>I have arranged and chaired internal seminars for the University of Leeds Astrophysics group. Additionally, I have organised and led weekly informal science sessions where members of the group get together to discuss their current work. During this time, I have included a journal club for astronomy session which has run once every three weeks.</p>

								<h4>Treasurer for University of Manchester Men’s Hockey Club, UK. May 2017 – May 2018.</h4>
								<p>I was elected out from a club of approximately 80 members. I managed up to £20,000 in financial transactions between the club, club members, the university’s Athletic Union, and between several different organisations.</p>
